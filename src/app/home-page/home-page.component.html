</h2>
<p class="col-12 col-md-10 text-center">This page was created using Bootstrap and NG Bootstrap for responsive design. 
    The table display transforms into a "Contact Card" to be more mobile-friendly. The search feature, edit and delete were added to enhance
    the user experience. 
    NGRX was used to create a unidirectional data flow and avoid mutating state. State management is a great way to help 
    keep an application maintainable and scalable and it is easily testable.  
    Reactive forms were used because they are easier
    to scale, have built in validator functions and adding custom validations is easy.  There is
    less setup for testing in comparison to template-driven forms.  Unit tests were added throughout to demonstrate understanding.
